# Computer Networks Laboratory
Part-A: Programming Assignments
1. System Information
Implement the following using C++/Java/Python:

A. Use an appropriate tool to find Host name, IP address, physical address, subnet mask, default gateway etc [hint: Ipconfig]. Explore different options available with the tool.
B. On the host system, identify the TCP connections, ports on which the computer is listening, Ethernet statistics, the IP routing table, IPV4statistics, and IPV4 statistics etc. using the appropriate tool [hint: netstat]. Explore different options available with the tool.


2. Frame Sorting
Write a program to sort frames using appropriate sorting techniques.

3. Error Detecting Code
Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).

4. Shortest Path
Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

5. Client-Server Program
Using TCP/IP sockets, write a clientâ€“server program to make the client send the file name and to make the server send back the contents of the requested file if present.

6. Datagram Socket
Write a program on datagram socket for client/server to display the messages on the client side, typed at the server side.

7. RSA Algorithm
Write a program for a simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data.

8. Congestion Control
Write a program for congestion control using the leaky bucket algorithm and token bucket algorithm.

9. Random Early Detection (RED)
Write a program to implement random early detection (RED) congestion control algorithm.



Part-B: Simulation Experiments
10. Point-to-Point Network
a. Implement three nodes point-to-point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.

b. Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.

11. Ethernet LAN
a. Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different source/destination.

b. Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in a wireless LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to the transmission of packets.
